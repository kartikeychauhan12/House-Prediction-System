# House-Prediction-System
This project provides a web application for predicting house prices in Bangalore using a pre-trained machine learning model. The application is built with *Streamlit* and offers an interactive interface for users to estimate house prices based on input features such as location, area, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms.

You can interact with the application by selecting a location, entering the area, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. The app will provide an estimated price for the house based on your inputs.
